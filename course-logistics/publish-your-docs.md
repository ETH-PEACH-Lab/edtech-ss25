# Course Format

This is a project-based course with weekly sessions that include a one-hour lecture on core topics, followed by a one-hour exercise session where students present their project progress and receive feedback from the instructional team. In addition to the class meetings, students are expected to dedicate at least two additional hours per week to working with their teammates on their projects.
