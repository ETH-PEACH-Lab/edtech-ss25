# Project Themes

* T1: Embodied Learning: Make Learning a Physical Experience
  * How can we connect the mind and body to make learning unforgettable? Build a tool that combines physical interaction—like gestures, movements, or tangible objects—with virtual elements (AR/VR) to help learners grasp abstract concepts. Whether it’s visualizing physics, coding with tangible blocks, or using gestures to solve math problems, let’s bring STEM education to life through action.

* T2: Active Learning: Turn Passive Learners into Active Explorers
  * Lectures are boring—how can we create experiences where learners actively engage with content? Design a platform or environment that encourages participation through hands-on activities, problem-solving, or interactive explorations. Think explorable explanations, dynamic simulations, or interactive group challenges. Let’s build tools that make learning a dynamic and personalized adventure.

* T3: Adaptive Learning: Tailor Education to Every Learner
  * Not everyone learns the same way. Your mission is to build an adaptive learning system that adjusts in real-time to each learner’s pace, preferences, and performance. Whether it’s offering personalized feedback, modifying lesson plans, or identifying learning gaps, your tool should ensure everyone can thrive in their educational journey.

* T4: Ubiquitous Learning: Learning Everywhere, Anytime
  * How can we make learning truly portable and seamless? Create a mobile or tablet system that allows learners to engage with educational content on the go. Whether it’s gamified quizzes on smartphones, learning while hiking, or bite-sized learning on-the-go, let’s make learning accessible anytime, anywhere.

* T5: Collaborative Learning: Build Together, Learn Together
  * Learning is better when we do it together. Design tools that empower learners to collaborate, whether in real-time or asynchronously. Think shared workspaces, peer-to-peer learning platforms, or interactive project tools. Your challenge: foster teamwork and community while keeping learners engaged, no matter the distance.

* T6: Playful Learning: Gamify the Learning Experience
  * Make learning fun! Create an educational game that combines engaging gameplay with teaching a skill or concept. Whether it’s a math adventure, a logic puzzle game, or a simulation that explains complex systems, your challenge is to make learning addictive and enjoyable. How can your game motivate learners while delivering real educational value?

* T7: Learning at Scale: Challenges in LARGE classrooms
  * Large classrooms shouldn’t mean impersonal learning. Design a platform that helps instructors manage large-scale education, providing personalized feedback, adaptive content, and tools to engage learners. Can you create a tool that solves the challenges in teaching, monitoring, and grading a 500 learners’ intro programming classroom?
